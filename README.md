## ðŸš€ About Me
Welcome to my GitHub! This is where I build, experiment, and refine my coding projects.

## ðŸ“‚ My Repositories
Here are some of my main projects:
- **[CodingProjects](https://github.com/zacheryfunch/CodingProjects)** â€“ A collection of coding experiments and implementations.
- **[Solutions](https://github.com/zacheryfunch/Solutions)** â€“ Problem-solving and coding solutions.

## âš¡ Current Project: ChronoDodoTimer
Iâ€™m developing **ChronoDodoTimer**, a web app designed to assist with getting little kids to have independent sleeping routines and sleeping through the night. The project aims to create a structured timer based on *ChronoDodo*, a french book for guiding kids to sleep.  'La methode chrono dodo' by Aude Becquart

   **ðŸŒŸ Features:**
- Timer sequences for sleep training rounds.
- A drop-down menu for program selection.
- Mobile-friendly design.


### ðŸ’¡ Future Plans
- Adding support for different sleep stages.
- Implementing notifications (sound, vibration, pop-ups).
- Collaborating with the author for insights & more products.
